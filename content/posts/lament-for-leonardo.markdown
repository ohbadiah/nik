I just caught up on my reading. For the first time in a little while, my reading progress is actually reflected by the number on [my Beeminder goal](http://beeminder.com/ohbadiah/pages). (The truth is a funny thing; I don't always tell it.) Being as I was about a hundred pages behind on Martin Kemp's biography of Leonardo da Vinci, a binge was required, and a transcontintental flight provided the expected opportunity.

Kemp's work is a master's portrait of the master. It's short, yet doesn't lend itself to quick reading because of the intricacy of the concepts and his narrative. In so doing it demonstrates clearly the nature of Leonardo's genius as well as its impact on subsequent history. As something of an anaesthete with respect to art, for the first time I have an idea what all the fuss is about the Mona Lisa.

Much of the difficulty in reading it is in visualizing Kemp's descriptions of Leonardo's mastery because we take for granted many of the effects Leonardo understood and demonstrated. We don't, for instance, consciously think about how colors and shapes alike become less distinct as an object recedes farther from us. Leonardo had to because he had to reproduce effects like these in order to make art that looked real. In painting he demonstrated such mastery over the laws of nature so as to become a nature in himself, able to recreate the world on canvas.

Slowly putting away the second half of this book on this flight provided a poignant study in contrast.

It is supremely ironic to learn about Leonardo aboard a flying machine surrounded by the video screens of my fellow passengers. These two technologies demonstrate humanity has achieved a mastery over the phenomena he wrestled with to an astounding degree. I wonder whether Leonardo could have imagined his ornithopter would be surpassed by such a startling margin, and the facsimile of the video camera removes all art from reproduction. Instead of Mona Lisa I see Caitlyn Jenner, our year's own marvel of feminine artifice.

da Vinci was a far greater man than I am. There is no shame in admitting that; Bill Gates is richer than me too. Understanding this is Kemp's gift. While reading, I thought it unfair that I should receive so easily the understanding that eluded even Leonardo's mind, the insight for which he plumbed great depths and could not find gift-wrapped and tidily arranged for me through school and Wikipedia. But then I realized that not only do the things that he knew elude me; the things that he did not know elude me as well.

For instance, Leonardo did not understand electricity and magnetism, but then neither do I, or at least not much better than he did. Sure, I can explain the basic underlying physics to an eighth grader who will subsequently do poorly on an exam I administer. But there is a difference between knowing about and really comprehending, understanding on a deep level. James Clerk Maxwell understood electricity and magnetism. So does Dave Goldberg, and so do many of my teachers, but I failed at or missed the opportunity to receive the understanding from them in college. No, despite operating light switches on a daily basis, I am no master of electricity.

Yet to mistake the usage of technology conceived by masters for mastery itself is a common fallacy. The former seductively tells us the latter is unnecessary, absurd, or impossible. Yet there remains much mastery to be had. We can tread in the footsteps of former masters, as I aspire to in my baking, or we can stand on their shoulders, as I aspire to in my computing. 

Leonardo's kind of mastery is in the cultural mandate, God's instructions to Adam and Eve to rule over the whole earth and subdue it. Either we take it for ourselves, or we deny the imago dei within us and insult our maker.
