It shouldn't have happened this way.

One of my earliest memories is of Lauren. We played a game at dinnertime. I would shake my head yes and she would shake her head no. Then one of us would switch and the other would follow suit. Somehow this game was really fun for us both. I guess I was 2 and she was 6.

Fast forward about ten years, the summer before I started eighth grade. Most of the time when we stayed at our cousins' I stayed with Anthony, but for some reason this time I stayed in Lauren's room. We got to talking, and for the first time maybe since that head-shaking game we really connected. We ended up talking until 3 or 4 in the morning, and we resolved not to let things drop there. We decided to become pen pals, even. We exchanged letters through the mail a few times before school must have started and that fell by the wayside.

I remember Lauren's promise in those days, her unbridled charisma and optimism. I remember how invigorated she was by the West Coast trip with Grandma and Grandpa, how she talked about ROTC and becoming a surgeon. I don't think anyone doubted that she could. But that must have been around when she first went off track. 

There's no getting around it. It's a tragedy that Lauren went off track when she was so young, that amidst her demons she couldn't care for her daughters and she lost them. Her long decline after that is tragic, too, but the worst part is it still didn't have to end this way. I'm so sorry that among all her sorrows she couldn't see the hope that was still there if she could have seen it. I'm also sorry I can't be there today.

Jinhee and I visited an old friend in a small city outside of Seoul yesterday. There we saw Stork Rock, which is a Catholic holy site because it's where over nearly three centuries well over three hundred people were martyred. The most memorable part was this little chapel toward the bottom of the hill. I had to turn sideways to fit in the front door. Then our host directed us down a narrow stair of sorts, something you had to climb down without being able to see more than the next step. Down there in the belly we knelt at a large rock, putting our hands on the cool stone and looking over at a portrait of Christ. Still; quiet; dark.

Yet our friend did not leave us there. The way out was not the way we came, but off to the side we hadn't seen was a corridor. And through the corridor, the light of day.

Yesterday was Good Friday. Tomorrow is Easter Sunday. That leaves today as what a friend has coined Awkward Saturday. We don't quite know what to do with this day because it straddles the worst thing that could have happened and the best thing that could have happened. It's not too different from thinking about Lauren. On the Friday side there is the long list of things that led her here far too early. On the Sunday side is the joy she did know and did bring and the deep love she did feel and express, along with the promise of the children she leaves behind who show much of the same beauty and ingenuity that their mother did.

As we remember her let's embrace this Saturday, not pretending that Friday wasn't Friday, but looking for an unlooked-for way out into the light of day. I am hopeful that Lauren in her misery looked for mercy, and found it. May we be good custodians of the extra days we have been given, that eluded her. Surely the days will also lead us here in time; and what then?
