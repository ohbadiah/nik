I and lots of people from my church went to Thailand last week. Our church has a new missions operation starting in north Thailand, near the city of Chiang Rai. Three of our people recently moved there to become missionaries. They're going to start a school in the area for local village kids. Also, and not completely unrelatedly, an old member of our church named Beau who is Thai got married in Bangkok at the end of the week.

See below for some photos of the affair.

With the indigo sky and the moon shining and the first star coming out it was just gorgeous. We felt a lot of kinship with the builders and their search for God. But then it was jarring to see in the middle just a big Buddha." %}}
