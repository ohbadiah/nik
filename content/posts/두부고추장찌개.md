![The stew](/img/두부고추장찌개.jpg)

Dinner last night. The funniest part of this is the shaker of black pepper they provide:

1.  So you're telling me this soup which is *made out of red pepper* might be a little bland, and to season according to my taste?
2.  I've seen peppercorns here, and I've seen shakers of ground black pepper, but I have not seen a pepper mill. In the kitchens I frequent we gave up pre-ground black pepper for the pepper mills a while ago, because it's bland. We may only have one spice on our table, but darn it, we grind it fresh!

Look at it bubbling. Yup, as served the stew is still boiling. What a wonderful steam bath.
