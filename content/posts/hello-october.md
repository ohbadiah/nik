Fall very suddenly arrived today, very fitting for October 1.

The weather has hardly changed since I arrived again on the 17th - basically 80 degrees and sunny every day. Today I woke to a torrential downpour outside. I had seen rain in the forecast but this was something else, and it persisted for several hours. After the storm there was a temperature drop of 15 or even 20 degrees, and the wind really kicked up. I suddenly felt unprepared in my tee and shorts.

I went to dinner at a new restaurant. One of the side dishes was this sort of acorn jelly, which I hadn't seen for a while. It was coincidence I'm sure but the reemergence of the acorn at the table seemed appropriate.

As I left I looked out the window at the bakery across the street, whose name seemed newly prescient.

Hello, October.
