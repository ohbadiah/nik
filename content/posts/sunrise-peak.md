I went to Jeju Island this week, and on Friday I took a solitary hike of one of the main attractions: 성산 일출봉, or Sunrise Peak at Seongsan. Well, the hike wasn't so solitary. I brought my camera, and many other tourists were there too. Here are the better of the pictures I took, in chronological order.

I didn't actually know precisely what was`the attraction that on the advice of my host I had come to see, but I had a pretty good idea it should be this island-looking thing in the distance." %}}

{{% galleryimage file="DSC_0984.JPG" size="1549x1037" caption="I'm not sure which was more impressive: the view of the peak from the distance, or the view of the distance from the peak. Life lesson?" %}}
